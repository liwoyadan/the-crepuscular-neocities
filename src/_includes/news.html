    <li><b>[23.09.06]</b> Woah haha it's been a year huh...anyways the site is now built with 11ty and deployed to Neocities from Github! Time to get back to work...</li>
    <li><b>[22.07.13]</b> The base of the site's layout has more or less been finished, so the home page is now live! There's still plenty of tweaks to be made, but the bulk of the start of this site is now all good to go.</li>
